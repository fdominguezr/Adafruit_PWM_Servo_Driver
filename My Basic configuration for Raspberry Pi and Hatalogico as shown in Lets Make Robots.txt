How I adapted my Raspberry Pi with Raspbian:

1. set keyboard with 

2. set display right in composite video

Take a backup of /boot/config.txt
sudo cp /boot/config.txt /boot/config.txt.backup
Open config.txt for editing
sudo nano /boot/config.txt
Uncomment the #disable_overscan=1 (Remove the #)
Comment all other overscan parameters
#overscan_left=10
#overscan_right=10
#overscan_top=15
#overscan_bottom=15
Save and exit. ( CTRL+X followed by Y to save)
Reboot
sudo reboot
On most monitors/TVs this would remove the black borders and make the desktop fill the whole screen. However if your display stil has some overscan you may need to keep the overscan parameters in config.txt file, but adjust the values:

overscan_left=-10
overscan_right=-10
overscan_top=-30
overscan_bottom=-30
More negative values means less black borders. Centre the display by trying different values for feft, right, top, bottom.

Picture spills off the size of the screen and some parts of the picture are outside the screen

This means you need positive overscan values.

overscan_left=10
overscan_right=10
overscan_top=30
overscan_bottom=30

3. get installed wifi

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install wicd-curses
Ok, now we are ready to start, type:
sudo wicd-curses

4. set DNS server
You can't just use nano (or vi) on /etc/resolv.conf. That will be overwritten every time you disconnect, reconnect, shutdown or reboot. Resolv.conf is updated by the ifup/ifdown process based on what's in your /etc/network/interfaces definitions.

Edit /etc/network/interfaces and add your preferred nameserver (my examples use Google's public servers)
CODE: SELECT ALL
iface eth0 inet dhcp
  dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4

and the same for WLAN0
CODE: SELECT ALL
iface wlan0 inet dhcp
  dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4

reboot and test with
ping google.com

5. install git

6. clone Hatalogico folder
7. run in Hatalogico folder this:
git submodule update --init --recursive

8. test installation with:
python ledCycle.py

LED attached to PWM0 should lit up and down
CTRL + Z to end

9.
